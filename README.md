# Fist_Game_Godot
This is my first platformer game built using the Godot Engine as a learning project. It features basic 2D platformer mechanics like movement, jumping, gravity, and collisions. Through this project, I explored Godot’s scene system, scripting, tile-based level design, and overall game structure while focusing on learning and experimentation.

This game uses: https://brackeysgames.itch.io/brackeys-platformer-bundle?utm_source=chatgpt.com
The bundle includes sprites, tilesets, sound effects, music, and fonts created by multiple talented artists and developers, including Brackeys, analogStudios_, RottingPixels, Sofia Thirslund, Asbjørn Thirslund, and Jayvee Enaguas (Pixel Operator font).

All assets from this bundle are released under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license, meaning they are free to use, modify, and distribute, even for commercial projects. Credit is not required, but it is given here out of respect for the creators.
