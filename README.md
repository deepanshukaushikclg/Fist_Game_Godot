# Fist_Game_Godot
This is my first platformer game built using the Godot Engine as a learning project. It features basic 2D platformer mechanics like movement, jumping, gravity, and collisions. Through this project, I explored Godot’s scene system, scripting, tile-based level design, and overall game structure while focusing on learning and experimentation.
